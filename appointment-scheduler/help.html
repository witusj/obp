<h2>Help Optimal outpatient appointment scheduling tool</h2>
This calculator uses a local search procedure that converges to the
optimal schedule with a weighted average of expected waiting times of
patients, idle time of the doctor and tardiness as an objective.
<br>
Because the local search procedure takes a very long time, two local search procedures
were implemented.<br>
<font dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 0px"></font>
- One with a smaller neighborhood, which doesn't guarantee us to derive the global optimum,
but gives good results within a reasonable time.<br>
<font dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 0px"></font>
- One with a big neighborhood, which guarantees us to derive the global optimum,
but the computing time can be very long.
<br>
The method of this tool is described in a <a href=http://www.math.vu.nl/~koole/articles/hcms07b>HCMS publication</a>.

<h3>Model</h3>
The model is a queuing system. The day/block length that a treatment/operation room is operational can be split in 
a number of equal intervals of some length (for example a day from 8.00AM till 4.00PM can be split in
48 intervals with length of 10 minutes). Within these intervals there should
a number of patients be scheduled.<br>
Our goal is to schedule these patients over those intervals in such a way that it minimizes the weighted average of
expected waiting times of patients, idle time of the doctor and tardiness.<br>
In the model we make the following assumptions:<br>
<font dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 0px"></font>
- The service times of patients are independent and exponential distributed.<br>
<font dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 0px"></font>
- Patients come always right on time.<br>
<font dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 0px"></font>
- Every patient has the same chance of not coming at all (no-show).<br>

<h3>Individual schedule</h3>
To calculate the individual schedule, the following parameters are used:<br>
<font dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 0px"></font>
- n: the nth patient.<br>
<font dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 0px"></font>
- N: the total number of patients.<br>
<font dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 0px"></font>
- I: the total number of intervals.<br>
<font dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 0px"></font>
- T: the length of an interval.<br>
The number of intervals are numbered from 1, ..., I.<br>
Patient n arrives in interval round((n-1) * I / N)+1 at time round((n-1) * I / N) * T.<br>
For example: N = 5 patients, I = 8 intervals and T = 15 minutes. <br>
Patient 3 arrives in interval round((3-1)*8/5)+1 = 4 at time round((3-1)*8/5)*15 = 00:45.<br>
