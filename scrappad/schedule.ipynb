    "The code above defines a `Schedule` class that has a constructor and a method to calculate the system states. The constructor initializes the class with three parameters: `x`, `d`, and `s`. These parameters are stored in a dictionary called `parameters`. The constructor also initializes two dictionaries called `system` and `state`. The `system` dictionary contains two numpy arrays called `p_min` and `v`. The `state` dictionary contains a single integer value that is initialized to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `calculate_system_states` method takes an optional parameter called `until` that defaults to 1. This method calculates the system states until the specified `until` value is reached. The method uses a while loop to iterate over the states until the `until` value is reached. The first step in the loop is to increment the `state` value by 1. \n",

    "The next step is to calculate the probability that the amount of work left in the system equals zero just before state `t` starts.

The result is stored in the `p_min` array.\n",

    "Overall, this code is well-organized and easy to read. However, there are a few ways to improve the code's readability and performance. For example, the `parameters` dictionary could be replaced with individual variables to make the code more readable. Additionally, the `convolve_n` function used in the code could be replaced with a more efficient implementation to improve performance. Finally, the comments in the code could be improved to provide more context and explanation for the calculations being performed."
